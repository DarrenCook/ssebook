CODE CONVENTIONS

All Languages

Indents are two spaces (no tabs). (Normally I'd use 4 spaces, but width is at a premium in books.)
When a line is broken, use either two spaces, or enough spaces to make things line up.
One space either side of operators, but not around any kind of brackets.
Opening brace on same line as the function/if/whatever, closing brace on its own line, indented the same as the associated block.


JavaScript

Variables and functions use camelCase. Abbreviations kept as uppercase (E.g. startSSE(), not startSse() )
